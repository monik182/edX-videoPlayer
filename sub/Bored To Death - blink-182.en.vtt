NOTE Paragraph

00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:14.995
There's an echoe pulling out the meaning

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:20.341
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream

00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:25.810
The voices in my head are always screaming

00:00:27.703 --> 00:00:30.810
That none of these means anything to me

00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:35.493
And It's a long way back from seventeen

00:00:35.703 --> 00:00:38.353
The whispers turn into a scream

00:00:38.484 --> 00:00:42.080
And I, I'm not coming home

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.807
Save your breath I'm nearly bored to death

00:00:47.168 --> 00:00:50.352
And fading fast

00:00:50.974 --> 00:00:54.129
Life is to short to last long

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.102
Back on earth I'm broken

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.927
Lost and cold and fading fast

00:01:03.055 --> 00:01:06.038
Life is too short to last long

00:01:06.586 --> 00:01:11.963
There's a stranger staring at the ceiling

00:01:12.295 --> 00:01:16.148
Rescuing a tiger from a tree

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:23.695
The pictures in her head are always dreaming

00:01:24.294 --> 00:01:29.448
Each of them means everything to me

00:01:29.654 --> 00:01:32.638
And It's a long way back from seventeen

00:01:32.908 --> 00:01:35.375
The whispers turn into a scream

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.044
And I, I'm not coming home

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.259
Save your breath I'm nearly bored to death

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:47.530
And fading fast

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:51.166
Life is too short to last long

00:01:51.626 --> 00:01:53.973
Back on earth I'm broken

00:01:54.234 --> 00:01:59.596
Lost and cold and fading fast

00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:02.996
Life is too short to last long

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:15.166
Oh ooh ooh...

00:02:15.182 --> 00:02:16.816
I think I met her at the minute

00:02:16.816 --> 00:02:19.058
That the rhythm was set down

00:02:19.058 --> 00:02:21.594
I said I'm sorry I'm a bit of a letdown

00:02:21.602 --> 00:02:23.462
But all my friends are daring me

00:02:23.462 --> 00:02:24.984
to come over

00:02:25.013 --> 00:02:27.099
So I come over and over and over

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:28.704
So let me buy you a drink

00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:30.074
and We'll pretend that you think

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:31.593
That I'm the man of your dreams

00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:33.542
Come to life in a dive bar

00:02:33.756 --> 00:02:45.138
And We'll go over and over and over

00:02:45.294 --> 00:02:47.794
Save your breath I'm nearly

00:02:47.972 --> 00:02:53.477
Bored to Death and fading fast

00:02:54.157 --> 00:02:56.916
Life is too short to last long

00:02:57.132 --> 00:02:59.733
Back on earth I'm broken

00:02:59.886 --> 00:03:06.003
Lost and cold and fading fast

00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:08.685
Life is too short to last long

00:03:08.872 --> 00:03:29.718
oh oh...

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.595
Life is too short to last long

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:44.942
oh oh...
